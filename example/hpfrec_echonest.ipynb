    "# Hierarchical Poisson Factorization\n",
    "** *\n",
    "This IPython notebook illustrates the usage of the [hpfrec](https://github.com/david-cortes/hpfrec) Python package for probabilistic Poisson matrix factorization on the [MillionSong TasteProfile dataset](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/tasteprofile) from EchoNest (48,000,000 entries from 1,000,000 users on 380,000 items). Unlike recommendations based on explicit user feedback such as movie ratings, recommending based on listening activity is harder as it is only an indirect measure of user preference, and doesn’t usually signal user dislikes.\n",
    "\n",
    "HPF (Hierarchical Poisson Factorization) is a probabilistic model that tries to factorize the user-item interaction count matrix as the product of two lower dimensional matrices, just like regular factorization methods used with explicit feedback data, but taking this product as the parameter of a Poisson random variable (thus the model likelihood optimization is different from minimizing the sum of least squares of residuals). Additionally, the user-attribute and item-attribute matrices are given a Bayesian gamma prior, making them non-negative and adjusting for the user activity and song popularity levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to competing methods such as BPR (Bayesian Personalized Ranking) or weighted-implicit ALS, it only requires iterating over the data for which an interaction was observed and not over data for which no interaction was observed (i.e. it doesn’t iterate over songs not played by the user), thus being more scalable, and at the same time producing better results when fit to counts data (in general).\n",
    "\n",
    "For a similar package incorporating also item side information see [ctpfrec](https://github.com/david-cortes/ctpfrec/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation here is based on the paper _Scalable Recommendation with Hierarchical Poisson Factorization (P. Gopalan, 2015)_. For more details see the [online documentation](http://hpfrec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n",

    "## 1. Model Decription\n",
    "The model consists in producing a non-negative matrix factorization of the User-Item activity matrix (a matrix where each entry corresponds to how many times each user interacted with each item) by the product of two lower-rank Matrices:\n",
    "$$ Y \\approx \\Theta \\beta^T $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Which can be interpreted as latent factors for users and items.\n",
    "\n",
    "These matrices are assumed to come from a generative process as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* For each user $u$:\n",
    "$\\xi_u \\sim Gamma(a', \\frac{a'}{b'})$\n",
    "    * For each latent factor $k$:\n",

    "\n",
    "**Note that this model can only make predictions for users and items that were present in the training data.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is fit using mean-field approximation (a form of Bayesian variational inference) with coordinate-ascent (updating each parameter separetely until convergence). For more details see the paper in the references.\n",
